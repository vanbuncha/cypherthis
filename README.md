# Encryption and Decryption Scripts
This repository contains two Python scripts, encrypt.py and decrypt.py, that provide encryption and decryption functionalities using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm.

## Encryption (encrypt.py)
### Description
The encrypt.py script takes a text file as input and encrypts its contents using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. The encrypted output is saved in chunks, making it more manageable for storage and transmission.


## Decryption (decrypt.py)
### Description
The decrypt.py script takes an encrypted text file and its corresponding encryption key as input and decrypts the contents using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm.
